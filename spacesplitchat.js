 I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
 All the days I waited for you
 You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you
 And you were out of my league
 All the things I believed
 You were just the right kind
 Yeah, you were more than just a dream
 You were out of my league
 Got my heartbeat racing
 If I die, don't wake me
 'Cause you are more than just a dream
 From time to time I pinch myself
 Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
 And every time she takes my hand
 All the wonders that remain
 Become a simple fact
 That you were out of my league
 All the things I believed
 You were just the right kind
 Yeah, you were more than just a dream
 You were out of my league
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah
And they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-oh
And they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Yeah, I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
